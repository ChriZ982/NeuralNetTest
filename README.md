# NeuralNetTest #

This is my test project for the NeuralNetLib.

### What is this repository for? ###

The task is to recognize handwritten digits. 
In this demo you can write some number on the screen and a neural network will tell you what it is. 
You can play around with different learning setups.
My best network has an accuracy of 98% on the test data. Go ahead and try to beat my accuracy. ;)

### What are neural networks? ###

Neural Networks are very small representations
of the human brain. Every network consists of different layers and performs
mathematical operations on them. The whole network can be seen as a black box
acting like a function. Networks can be trained so that a specific input is
resulting in a desired output.
