# NeuralNetTest #

This is my test project for the NeuralNetLib.

Current line count: ~600 lines

### What is this repository for? ###

The task is to recognize handwritten digits. 
In this demo you can write some number on the screen and a neural network will tell you what it is. 
You can play around with different learning setups.
My best network has an accuracy of 98% on the test data. Try to beat me ;)
