# NeuralNetTest #

This is my test project for the NeuralNetLib.

Current line count: ~1000 lines

### What is this repository for? ###

The task is to recognize handwritten digits. 
In this demo you can write some number on the screen and a neural network will tell you what it is. 
You can play around with different learning setups.
My best network has an accuracy of 98% on the test data. Try to beat me ;)

### What libraries do I use? ###

* [NeuralNetLib by ChriZ98](https://bitbucket.org/ChriZ98/neuralnetlib)
* [MathLib by ChriZ98](https://bitbucket.org/ChriZ98/mathlib)
